"Originally, Sphinx was conceived for a single project, the documentation of "
"the Python language.  Shortly afterwards, it was made available for everyone"
" as a documentation tool, but the documentation of Python modules remained "
"deeply built in -- the most fundamental directives, like ``function``, were "
"designed for Python objects.  Since Sphinx has become somewhat popular, "
"interest developed in using it for many different purposes: C/C++ projects, "
"JavaScript, or even reStructuredText markup (like in this documentation)."

"While this was always possible, it is now much easier to easily support "
"documentation of projects using different programming languages or even ones"
" not supported by the main Sphinx distribution, by providing a **domain** "
"for every such purpose."

"A domain is a collection of markup (reStructuredText :term:`directive`\\ s "
"and :term:`role`\\ s) to describe and link to :term:`object`\\ s belonging "
"together, e.g. elements of a programming language.  Directive and role names"
" in a domain have names like ``domain:name``, e.g. ``py:function``.  Domains"
" can also provide custom indices (like the Python Module Index)."

"Having domains means that there are no naming problems when one set of "
"documentation wants to refer to e.g. C++ and Python classes.  It also means "
"that extensions that support the documentation of whole new languages are "
"much easier to write."

"Most domains provide a number of :dfn:`object description directives`, used "

"A domain will typically keep an internal index of all entities to aid cross-"
"referencing. Typically, it will also add entries in the shown general index."
" If you want to suppress the addition of an entry in the shown index, you "
"can give the directive option flag ``:no-index-entry:``. If you want to "
"exclude the object description from the table of contents, you can give the "
"directive option flag ``:no-contents-entry:``. If you want to typeset an "
"object description, without even making it available for cross-referencing, "
"you can give the directive option flag ``:no-index:`` (which implies ``:no-"
"index-entry:``). If you do not want to typeset anything, you can give the "
"directive option flag ``:no-typesetting:``.  This can for example be used to"
" create only a target and index entry for later reference. Though, note that"
