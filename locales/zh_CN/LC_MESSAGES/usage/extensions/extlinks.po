msgid ""
"This extension is meant to help with the common pattern of having many "
"external links that point to URLs on one and the same site, e.g. links to "
"bug trackers, version control web interfaces, or simply subpages in other "
"websites.  It does so by providing aliases to base URLs, so that you only "
"need to give the subpage name when creating a link."
msgstr ""
"此扩展旨在帮助实现一种常见模式，即有许多指向同一站点上url的外部链接，例如指向bug追踪器、版本控制web界面的链接，或者只是其他网站中的子页面的链接。它通过为基本url提供别名来实现这一点，因此您只需要在创建链接时提供子页面名称。"

"Let's assume that you want to include many links to issues at the Sphinx "
"tracker, at :samp:`https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/{num}`.  "
"Typing this URL again and again is tedious, so you can use "
":mod:`~sphinx.ext.extlinks` to avoid repeating yourself."
msgstr ""
"假设您希望在Sphinx tracker上包含许多指向问题的链接，地址：samp:`https://github.com/sphinx-"
"doc/sphinx/issues/{num}`。一次又一次地键入此URL是很乏味的，因此可以使用：mod:`~sphinx.ext.extlinks`为了避免重复你自己。"

msgstr "该插件添加了一个配置值："

#: ../../sphinx/doc/usage/extensions/extlinks.rst:25
msgid ""
"This config value must be a dictionary of external sites, mapping unique "
"short alias names to a *base URL* and a *caption*.  For example, to create "
"an alias for the above mentioned issues, you would add ::"

#: ../../sphinx/doc/usage/extensions/extlinks.rst:32
msgid ""
"Now, you can use the alias name as a new role, e.g. ``:issue:`123```.  This "
"then inserts a link to https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/123. As "
"you can see, the target given in the role is substituted in the *base URL* "
"in the place of ``%s``."

"The link caption depends on the second item in the tuple, the *caption*:"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *caption* is a string, then it must contain ``%s`` exactly once.  In this"
" case the link caption is *caption* with the partial URL substituted for "

"Since links are generated from the role in the reading stage, they appear as"
" ordinary links to e.g. the ``linkcheck`` builder."

"If enabled, extlinks emits a warning if a hardcoded link is replaceable by "
