msgstr ""

msgid "This is what you can do in an extension: First, you can add new :term:`builder`\\s to support new output formats or actions on the parsed documents.  Then, it is possible to register custom reStructuredText roles and directives, extending the markup.  And finally, there are so-called \"hook points\" at strategic places throughout the build process, where an extension can register a hook and run specialized code."

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:16
msgid "An extension is simply a Python module.  When an extension is loaded, Sphinx imports this module and executes its ``setup()`` function, which in turn notifies Sphinx of everything the extension offers -- see the extension tutorial for examples."

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:21
msgid "The configuration file itself can be treated as an extension if it contains a ``setup()`` function.  All other extensions to load must be listed in the :confval:`extensions` configuration value."

msgid "``'version'``: a string that identifies the extension version.  It is used for extension version requirement checking (see :confval:`needs_extensions`) and informational purposes.  If not given, ``\"unknown version\"`` is substituted."

msgid "``'parallel_read_safe'``: a boolean that specifies if parallel reading of source files can be used when the extension is loaded.  It defaults to ``False``, i.e. you have to explicitly specify your extension to be parallel-read-safe after checking that it is."

msgid "``'parallel_write_safe'``: a boolean that specifies if parallel writing of output files can be used when the extension is loaded.  Since extensions usually don't negatively influence the process, this defaults to ``True``."
