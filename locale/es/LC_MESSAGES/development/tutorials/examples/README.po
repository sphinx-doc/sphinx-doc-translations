"This directory contains a number of examples used in the tutorials. These "
"are intended to be increasingly complex to demonstrate the various features "
"of Sphinx, but should aim to be as complicated as necessary but no more. "
"Individual sections are referenced by line numbers, meaning if you make "
"changes to the source files, you should update the references in the "
"documentation accordingly."
