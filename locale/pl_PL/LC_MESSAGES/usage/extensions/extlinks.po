msgid ""
"This extension is meant to help with the common pattern of having many "
"external links that point to URLs on one and the same site, e.g. links to "
"bug trackers, version control web interfaces, or simply subpages in other "
"websites.  It does so by providing aliases to base URLs, so that you only "
"need to give the subpage name when creating a link."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/usage/extensions/extlinks.rst:16
msgid ""
"Let's assume that you want to include many links to issues at the Sphinx "
"tracker, at :samp:`https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/{num}`.  "
"Typing this URL again and again is tedious, so you can use "
":mod:`~sphinx.ext.extlinks` to avoid repeating yourself."

msgid "The extension adds a config value:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/usage/extensions/extlinks.rst:25
msgid ""
"This config value must be a dictionary of external sites, mapping unique "
"short alias names to a *base URL* and a *caption*.  For example, to create "
"an alias for the above mentioned issues, you would add ::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/usage/extensions/extlinks.rst:32
msgid ""
"Now, you can use the alias name as a new role, e.g. ``:issue:`123```.  This "
"then inserts a link to https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/123. As "
"you can see, the target given in the role is substituted in the *base URL* "
"in the place of ``%s``."

"If *caption* is a string, then it must contain ``%s`` exactly once.  In this"
" case the link caption is *caption* with the partial URL substituted for "
