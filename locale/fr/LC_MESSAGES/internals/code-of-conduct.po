"Like the technical community as a whole, the Sphinx team and community is "
"made up of volunteers from all over the world. Diversity is a strength, but "
"it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we "
"have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to."

"Tout comme l'ensemble de la communauté technique, celle de Sphinx, au même "
"titre que son équipe, est composée de bénévoles des quatre coins du monde. "
"La diversité est une force, mais elle peut aussi conduire à des problèmes de"
" communication et à des conflits. C'est pour cela que nous avons établi "
"quelques règles fondamentales que nous demandons aux gens de respecter."

"**Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports "
"people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited "
"to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, "
"immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, "
"sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family "

"**Soyez accueillant.** Nous aspirons à être une communauté qui accueille et "

"identités et expressions de genre, âges, tailles, status familiaux, avis "

"**Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn "
"will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users "
"and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when "
"making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might "
"not be communicating in someone else's primary language."
msgstr ""
"**Soyez responsables.** Votre travail sera utilisé par d'autres personnes, "
"tout comme vous êtes dépendant du travail d'autres personnes. Chaque "
"décision que vous prenez affectera d'autres utilisateurs et collègues, ce "
"qui est à prendre en compte avant de décider. N'oubliez pas que nous sommes "
"une communauté mondiale, donc que la langue dans laquelle vous communiquez "
"n'est peut-être pas la langue maternelle des autres."

"**Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement "
"is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience "
"some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn "
"into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where "
"people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of "
"the Sphinx community should be respectful when dealing with other members as"
" well as with people outside the Sphinx community."

"**When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and "
"technical, happen all the time and Sphinx is no exception. It is important "
"that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember "
"that we're different. Different people have different perspectives on "
"issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't "
"mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming "
"each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve "
"issues and learning from mistakes."

"of conduct applies to all spaces of the Sphinx community."
