"A field list near the top of a file is normally parsed by docutils as the "
"*docinfo* which is generally used to record the author, date of publication "
"and other metadata.  However, in Sphinx, a field list preceding any other "
"markup is moved from the *docinfo* to the Sphinx environment as document "
"metadata and is not displayed in the output; a field list appearing after "
"the document title will be part of the *docinfo* as normal and will be "
"displayed in the output."
