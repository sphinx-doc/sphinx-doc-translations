"Each output format has some specific configuration options that you can "

"URLs are shown right after the corresponding link, in parentheses.  You can "

"Generating a PDF using Sphinx can be done running ``make latexpdf``, "

" LaTeX requires careful configuration in some cases, so PDF generation is "
