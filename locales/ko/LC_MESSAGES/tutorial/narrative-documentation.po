"The file ``index.rst`` created by ``sphinx-quickstart`` is the :term:`root "
"document`, whose main function is to serve as a welcome page and to contain "
"the root of the \"table of contents tree\" (or *toctree*).  Sphinx allows "
"you to assemble a project from different files, which is helpful when the "
"project grows."

"The structure of the document is determined by the succession of heading "

"Alternatively, you can also add a cross-reference to an arbitrary part of "

"Notice a trick here: the ``install`` part specifies how the link will look "
"like (we want it to be a specific word, so the sentence makes sense), "
"whereas the ``<installation>`` part refers to the actual label we want to "
"add a cross-reference to. If you do not include an explicit title, hence "
"using ``:ref:`installation```, the section title will be used (in this case,"
" ``Installation``). Both the ``:doc:`` and the ``:ref:`` roles will be "
