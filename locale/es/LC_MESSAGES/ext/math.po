msgid ""
"Since mathematical notation isn't natively supported by HTML in any way, "
"Sphinx supports math in documentation with several extensions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:14
msgid ""
"The basic math support is contained in :mod:`sphinx.ext.mathbase`. Other "
"math support extensions should, if possible, reuse that support too."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:19
msgid ""
":mod:`.mathbase` is not meant to be added to the :confval:`extensions` "
"config value, instead, use either :mod:`sphinx.ext.imgmath` or "
":mod:`sphinx.ext.mathjax` as described below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:23
msgid ""
"The input language for mathematics is LaTeX markup.  This is the de-facto "
"standard for plain-text math notation and has the added advantage that no "
"further translation is necessary when building LaTeX output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:27
msgid ""
"Keep in mind that when you put math markup in **Python docstrings** read by "
":mod:`autodoc <sphinx.ext.autodoc>`, you either have to double all "
"backslashes, or use Python raw strings (``r\"raw\"``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ":mod:`.mathbase` provides the following config values:"

"Set this option to ``True`` if you want all displayed math to be numbered. "

"blank line::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:59

"In addition, each single equation is set within a ``split`` environment, "

"When the math is only one line of text, it can also be given as a directive "
"argument::"

#: ../../ext/math.rst:76
msgid ""
"Normally, equations are not numbered.  If you want your equation to get a "
"number, use the ``label`` option.  When given, it selects an internal label "
"for the equation, by which it can be cross-referenced, and causes an "
"equation number to be issued.  See :rst:role:`eqref` for an example.  The "
"numbering style depends on the output format."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:82
msgid ""
"There is also an option ``nowrap`` that prevents any wrapping of the given "
"math in a math environment.  When you give this option, you must make sure "
"yourself that the math is properly set up.  For example::"

msgstr ""

#: ../../ext/math.rst:114
msgid ""
"This extension renders math via LaTeX and dvipng_ or dvisvgm_ into PNG or "
"SVG images. This of course means that the computer where the docs are built "
"must have both programs available."

"There are various config values you can set to influence how the images are "

"Since this setting is not portable from system to system, it is normally not"

"preferable, like this::"

"``dvipng`` has the ability to determine the \"depth\" of the rendered text: "
"for example, when typesetting a fraction inline, the baseline of surrounding"
" text should not be flush with the bottom of the image, rather the image "
"should extend a bit below the baseline.  This is what TeX calls \"depth\".  "
"When this is enabled, the images put into the HTML document will get a "
