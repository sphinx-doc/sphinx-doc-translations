"Sphinx supports changing the appearance of its HTML output via *themes*.  A "
"theme is a collection of HTML templates, stylesheet(s) and other static "
"files. Additionally, it has a configuration file which specifies from which "
"theme to inherit, which highlighting style to use, and what options exist "
"for customizing the theme's look and feel."

"Using an existing theme is easy.  If the theme is builtin to Sphinx, you "
"only need to set the :confval:`html_theme` config value.  With the "
":confval:`html_theme_options` config value you can set theme-specific "
"options that change the look and feel.  For example, you could have the "
"following in your :file:`conf.py`::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../theming.rst:33

"That would give you the classic theme, but with a sidebar on the right side "
"and a black background for the relation bar (the bar with the navigation "
"links at the page's top and bottom)."

msgid ""
"If the theme does not come with Sphinx, it can be in two static forms: "
"either a directory (containing :file:`theme.conf` and other needed files), "
"or a zip file with the same contents.  Either of them must be put where "
"Sphinx can find it; for this there is the config value "
":confval:`html_theme_path`.  It gives a list of directories, relative to the"
" directory containing :file:`conf.py`, that can contain theme directories or"
" zip files.  For example, if you have a theme in the file :file:`blue.zip`, "
"you can put it right in the directory containing :file:`conf.py` and use "
"this configuration::"
