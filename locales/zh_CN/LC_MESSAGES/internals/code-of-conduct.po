"Like the technical community as a whole, the Sphinx team and community is "
"made up of volunteers from all over the world. Diversity is a strength, but "
"it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we "
"have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to."
msgstr ""
"像整个技术社区一样，sphinx团队和社区由来自世界各地的志愿者组成。多样性是一种优势，但它也可能导致沟通问题和不愉快。为此，我们有一些基本规则，我们要求人们遵守。"

"**Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports "
"people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited "
"to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, "
"immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, "
"sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family "
"status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability."

"我们努力成为一个欢迎和支持各种背景和身份的人的社区。这包括但不限于任何种族、族裔、文化、民族血统、肤色、移民状况、社会经济阶层、教育程度、性别、性取向、性别认同和表达、年龄、大小、家庭状况、政治信仰、宗教信仰、身心能力。"

"**Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn "
"will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users "
"and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when "
"making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might "
"not be communicating in someone else's primary language."
msgstr ""
"善解人意。你的工作会被别人利用，而你又会依赖别人的工作。你所做的任何决定都会影响到用户和同事，你在做决定时应该考虑到这些后果。请记住，我们是一个世界性的社区，因此您可能不会使用其他人的主要语言进行交流。"

msgid ""
"**Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement "
"is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience "
"some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn "
"into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where "
"people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of "
"the Sphinx community should be respectful when dealing with other members as"
" well as with people outside the Sphinx community."
msgstr ""
"要有礼貌。不是所有人都会一直意见一致，但意见不合不能成为不良行为和不良举止的借口。我们可能会时不时地经历一些挫折，但我们不能让这种挫折变成人身攻击。重要的是要记住，一个让人感到不舒服或受到威胁的社区并不是一个富有成效的社区。sphinx社区的成员在与其他成员以及sphinx社区以外的人打交道时应该尊重他人。"

"**When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and "
"technical, happen all the time and Sphinx is no exception. It is important "
"that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember "
"that we're different. Different people have different perspectives on "
"issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't "
"mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming "
"each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve "
"issues and learning from mistakes."
msgstr ""
"当我们不同意的时候，试着去理解为什么社会和技术上的分歧总是会发生，shpinx也不例外。我们必须建设性地解决分歧和不同意见。记住我们是不同的。不同的人对问题有不同的看法。不能理解为什么有人持有观点并不意味着他们错了。别忘了犯错是人之常情，互相指责并不能让我们一事无成。相反，集中精力帮助解决问题和从错误中吸取教训。"

msgstr ""
"这不是一个详尽的清单，你不能做的事情。相反，要以它的本意来理解它——一个使我们所有人和我们所参与的技术社区更容易丰富的指南。本行为准则适用于sphinx社区的所有空间。"
