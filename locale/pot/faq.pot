You may even use `FontForge <https://fontforge.github.io/>`_ and create narrow variants of some free font.  In my case I get up to 70 characters on a line."

If set to the value of ``hide``, Emacs will hide both the ``*note:`` part and the ``target-id``.  This is generally the best way to view Sphinx-based documents since they often make frequent use of links and do not take this limitation into account.  However, changing this variable affects how all Info documents are displayed and most do take this behavior into account."
