msgid "This directory contains a number of examples used in the tutorials. These are intended to be increasingly complex to demonstrate the various features of Sphinx, but should aim to be as complicated as necessary but no more. Individual sections are referenced by line numbers, meaning if you make changes to the source files, you should update the references in the documentation accordingly."
