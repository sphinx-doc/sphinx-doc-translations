msgid "This is a subclass of the standard HTML builder.  Its output is a directory with HTML files, where each file is called ``index.html`` and placed in a subdirectory named like its page name.  For example, the document ``markup/rest.rst`` will not result in an output file ``markup/rest.html``, but ``markup/rest/index.html``.  When generating links between pages, the ``index.html`` is omitted, so that the URL would look like ``markup/rest/``."

msgid "In order to generate a valid help book, this builder requires the command line tool :program:`hiutil`, which is only available on Mac OS X 10.6 and above.  You can disable the indexing step by setting :confval:`applehelp_disable_external_tools` to ``True``, in which case the output will not be valid until :program:`hiutil` has been run on all of the ``.lproj`` folders within the bundle."
