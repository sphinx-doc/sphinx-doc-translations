"Since many projects will need special features in their documentation, "

"This is what you can do in an extension: First, you can add new "
":term:`builder`\\s to support new output formats or actions on the parsed "
"documents.  Then, it is possible to register custom reStructuredText roles "
"and directives, extending the markup.  And finally, there are so-called "
"\"hook points\" at strategic places throughout the build process, where an "
"extension can register a hook and run specialized code."

"An extension is simply a Python module.  When an extension is loaded, Sphinx"

"tutorial for examples."

"Builder extensions should define an entry point in the ``sphinx.builders`` "

"serialized to disk after each build."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:77

msgid "**Phase 0: Initialization**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:113

"In Phase 1, all source files (and on subsequent builds, those that are new "
"or changed) are read and parsed.  This is the phase where directives and "
"roles are encountered by docutils, and the corresponding code is executed.  "
"The output of this phase is a *doctree* for each source file; that is a tree"
" of docutils nodes.  For document elements that aren't fully known until all"
" existing files are read, temporary nodes are created."

"Now that the metadata and cross-reference data of all existing documents is "
"known, all temporary nodes are replaced by nodes that can be converted into "
"output using components called transforms.  For example, links are created "

"This phase converts the resolved doctrees to the desired output format, such"
