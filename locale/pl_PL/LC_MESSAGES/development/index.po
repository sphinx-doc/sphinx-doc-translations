"This guide is aimed at giving a quick introduction for those wishing to "
"develop their own extensions for Sphinx. Sphinx possesses significant "
"extensibility capabilities including the ability to hook into almost every "
"point of the build process.  If you simply wish to use Sphinx with existing "
"extensions, refer to :doc:`/usage/index`. For a more detailed discussion of "
"the extension interface see :doc:`/extdev/index`."
