"Usage is simple: whenever Sphinx encounters a cross-reference that has no "
"matching target in the current documentation set, it looks for targets in "
"the documentation sets configured in :confval:`intersphinx_mapping`.  A "
"reference like ``:py:class:`zipfile.ZipFile``` can then link to the Python "
"documentation for the ZipFile class, without you having to specify where it "
"is located exactly."

"When using the \"new\" format (see below), you can even force lookup in a "

"By default, the mapping file is assumed to be at the same location as the "
