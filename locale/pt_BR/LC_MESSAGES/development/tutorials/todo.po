"The objective of this tutorial is to create a more comprehensive extension "
"than that created in :doc:`helloworld`. Whereas that guide just covered "
"writing a custom :term:`directive`, this guide adds multiple directives, "
"along with custom nodes, additional config values and custom event handlers."
" To this end, we will cover a ``todo`` extension that adds capabilities to "
"include todo entries in the documentation, and to collect these in a central"
" place. This is similar the ``sphinxext.todo`` extension distributed with "
"Sphinx."

"A directive class is a class deriving usually from "

"It's very simple, creating and returning an instance of our ``todolist`` "
"node class.  The ``TodolistDirective`` directive itself has neither content "
"nor arguments that need to be handled. That brings us to the "
"``TodoDirective`` directive:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/development/tutorials/todo.rst:150
msgid ""
"Several important things are covered here. First, as you can see, we're now "
"subclassing the :class:`~sphinx.util.docutils.SphinxDirective` helper class "
"instead of the usual :class:`~docutils.parsers.rst.Directive` class. This "
"gives us access to the :ref:`build environment instance <important-objects>`"
" using the ``self.env`` property. Without this, we'd have to use the rather "
"convoluted ``self.state.document.settings.env``. Then, to act as a link "
"target (from ``TodolistDirective``), the ``TodoDirective`` directive needs "
"to return a target node in addition to the ``todo`` node.  The target ID (in"
" HTML, this will be the anchor name) is generated by using "
"``env.new_serialno`` which returns a new unique integer on each call and "
"therefore leads to unique target names. The target node is instantiated "
"without any text (the first two arguments)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/development/tutorials/todo.rst:162
msgid ""
"On creating admonition node, the content body of the directive are parsed "
"using ``self.state.nested_parse``.  The first argument gives the content "
"body, and the second one gives content offset.  The third argument gives the"
" parent node of parsed result, in our case the ``todo`` node. Following "
"this, the ``todo`` node is added to the environment.  This is needed to be "
"able to create a list of all todo entries throughout the documentation, in "
"the place where the author puts a ``todolist`` directive.  For this case, "
"the environment attribute ``todo_all_todos`` is used (again, the name should"
" be unique, so it is prefixed by the extension name).  It does not exist "
"when a new environment is created, so the directive must check and create it"
" if necessary.  Various information about the todo entry's location are "
"stored along with a copy of the node."
msgstr ""

msgid "The event handlers"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/development/tutorials/todo.rst:195
msgid ""
"Event handlers are one of Sphinx's most powerful features, providing a way "
"to do hook into any part of the documentation process. There are many events"
" provided by Sphinx itself, as detailed in :ref:`the API guide <events>`, "
"and we're going to use a subset of them here."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/development/tutorials/todo.rst:200

"Let's look at the event handlers used in the above example.  First, the one "
"for the :event:`env-purge-doc` event:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/development/tutorials/todo.rst:208
msgid ""
"Since we store information from source files in the environment, which is "
"persistent, it may become out of date when the source file changes.  "
"Therefore, before each source file is read, the environment's records of it "
"are cleared, and the :event:`env-purge-doc` event gives extensions a chance "
"to do the same. Here we clear out all todos whose docname matches the given "
"one from the ``todo_all_todos`` list.  If there are todos left in the "
"document, they will be added again during parsing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/development/tutorials/todo.rst:216
msgid ""
"The next handler, for the :event:`env-merge-info` event, is used during "
"parallel builds. As during parallel builds all threads have their own "
"``env``, there's multiple ``todo_all_todos`` lists that need to be merged:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/development/tutorials/todo.rst:227
msgid "The other handler belongs to the :event:`doctree-resolved` event:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/development/tutorials/todo.rst:234
msgid ""
"The :event:`doctree-resolved` event is emitted at the end of :ref:`phase 3 "
"(resolving) <build-phases>` and allows custom resolving to be done. The "
"handler we have written for this event is a bit more involved. If the "
"``todo_include_todos`` config value (which we'll describe shortly) is false,"
" all ``todo`` and ``todolist`` nodes are removed from the documents. If not,"
" ``todo`` nodes just stay where and how they are.  ``todolist`` nodes are "
"replaced by a list of todo entries, complete with backlinks to the location "
"where they come from.  The list items are composed of the nodes from the "
"``todo`` entry and docutils nodes created on the fly: a paragraph for each "
"entry, containing text that gives the location, and a link (reference node "
"containing an italic node) with the backreference. The reference URI is "
"built by :meth:`sphinx.builders.Builder.get_relative_uri` which creates a "
"suitable URI depending on the used builder, and appending the todo node's "
"(the target's) ID as the anchor name."

msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/development/tutorials/todo.rst:269

"If the third argument was ``'html'``, HTML documents would be full rebuild "

"that influence reading (build :ref:`phase 1 (reading) <build-phases>`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/development/tutorials/todo.rst:273
msgid ""
":meth:`~Sphinx.add_node` adds a new *node class* to the build system.  It "
"also can specify visitor functions for each supported output format.  These "
"visitor functions are needed when the new nodes stay until :ref:`phase 4 "
"(writing) <build-phases>`. Since the ``todolist`` node is always replaced in"
" :ref:`phase 3 (resolving) <build-phases>`, it doesn't need any."
