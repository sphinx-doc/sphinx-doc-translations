"An extension is simply a Python module with a ``setup()`` function. A user "

"module) in their :confval:`extensions` configuration value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:23
msgid ""
"When :program:`sphinx-build` is executed, Sphinx will attempt to import each"
" module that is listed, and execute ``yourmodule.setup(app)``. This function"
" is used to prepare the extension (e.g., by executing Python code), linking "
"resources that Sphinx uses in the build process (like CSS or HTML files), "
"and notifying Sphinx of everything the extension offers (such as directive "
"or role definitions). The ``app`` argument is an instance of "
":class:`.Sphinx` and gives you control over most aspects of the Sphinx "
"build."

msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:100
msgid ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:107
msgid ""
"In Phase 1, all source files (and on subsequent builds, those that are new "
"or changed) are read and parsed.  This is the phase where directives and "
"roles are encountered by docutils, and the corresponding code is executed.  "
"The output of this phase is a *doctree* for each source file; that is a tree"
" of docutils nodes.  For document elements that aren't fully known until all"
" existing files are read, temporary nodes are created."

"Now that the metadata and cross-reference data of all existing documents is "

"This phase converts the resolved doctrees to the desired output format, such"
