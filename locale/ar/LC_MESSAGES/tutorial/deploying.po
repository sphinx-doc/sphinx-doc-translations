"When you are ready to show your documentation project to the world, there "
"are many options available to do so. Since the HTML generated by Sphinx is "
"static, you can decouple the process of building your HTML documentation "
"from hosting such files in the platform of your choice. You will not need a "
"sophisticated server running Python: virtually every web hosting service "
"will suffice."
msgstr ""

"Therefore, the challenge is less how or where to serve the static HTML, but "
"rather how to pick a workflow that automatically updates the deployed "
"documentation every time there is a change in the source files."

"`Read the Docs`_ is an online service specialized in hosting technical "

"`GitHub Pages`_ is a simple static web hosting tightly integrated with "
"`GitHub`_: static HTML is served from one of the branches of a project, and "
