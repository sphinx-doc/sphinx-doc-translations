msgid "Each output format has some specific configuration options that you can tune, :ref:`including EPUB <epub-options>`.  For instance, the default value of :confval:`epub_show_urls` is ``inline``, which means that, by default, URLs are shown right after the corresponding link, in parentheses.  You can change that behavior by adding the following code at the end of your ``conf.py``:"

msgid "Generating a PDF using Sphinx can be done running ``make latexpdf``, provided that the system has a working LaTeX installation, as explained in the documentation of :class:`sphinx.builders.latex.LaTeXBuilder`. Although this is perfectly feasible, such installations are often big, and in general LaTeX requires careful configuration in some cases, so PDF generation is out of scope for this tutorial."
