"Jinja, the template engine used for the default HTML templates, is now no "

" in that case please also remove the ``sphinx/jinja`` directory that may be "
"left over from old revisions."

"called ``defindex.html``, and you can port your html_index template, using "
"Jinja inheritance, by changing your template::"
