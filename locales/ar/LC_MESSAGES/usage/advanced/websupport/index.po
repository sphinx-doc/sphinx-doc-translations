"**Historical context**: Web Support originated from the `Pocoo`_ community, "
"the original creators of Sphinx, Jinja, Flask, Pygments, and more. Web "
"Support was part of a plan to create a forum application that tied together "
"Jinja, Flask, Sphinx, etc. The core goal behind Web Support was to enable a "
"user editing and suggestion layer on top of documentation. While the concept"
" has merit, the feature has seen limited adoption and development over the "
"years. As of 2025, there are few real-world examples of its use. See "
"`sphinx-websupport-app`_ for one such example."
