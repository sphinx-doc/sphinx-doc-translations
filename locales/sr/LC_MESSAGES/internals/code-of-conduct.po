"Like the technical community as a whole, the Sphinx team and community is "
"made up of volunteers from all over the world. Diversity is a strength, but "
"it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we "
"have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to."

"**Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports "
"people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited "
"to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, "
"immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, "
"sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family "
"status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability."

"**Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn "
"will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users "
"and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when "
"making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might "
"not be communicating in someone else's primary language."

"**Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement "
"is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience "
"some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn "
"into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where "
"people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of "
"the Sphinx community should be respectful when dealing with other members as"
" well as with people outside the Sphinx community."

"**When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and "
"technical, happen all the time and Sphinx is no exception. It is important "
"that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember "
"that we're different. Different people have different perspectives on "
"issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't "
"mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming "
"each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve "
"issues and learning from mistakes."

"all of us and the technical communities in which we participate. This code "
"of conduct applies to all spaces of the Sphinx community."
