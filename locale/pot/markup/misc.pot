msgid "A field list near the top of a file is parsed by docutils as the \"docinfo\" which is normally used to record the author, date of publication and other metadata.  *In Sphinx*, a field list preceding any other markup is moved from the docinfo to the Sphinx environment as document metadata and is not displayed in the output; a field list appearing after the document title will be part of the docinfo as normal and will be displayed in the output."

msgid "Tables that contain list-like elements such as object descriptions, blockquotes or any kind of lists cannot be set out of the box with ``tabulary``.  They are therefore set with the standard LaTeX ``tabular`` environment if you don't give a ``tabularcolumns`` directive.  If you do, the table will be set with ``tabulary``, but you must use the ``p{width}`` construct for the columns that contain these elements."
msgstr ""

msgid "Literal blocks do not work with ``tabulary`` at all, so tables containing a literal block are always set with ``tabular``.  Also, the verbatim environment used for literal blocks only works in ``p{width}`` columns, which means that by default, Sphinx generates such column specs for such tables."
