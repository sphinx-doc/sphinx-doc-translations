"Builder extensions should define an entry point in the ``sphinx.builders`` "
"group. The name of the entry point needs to match your builder's "
":attr:`~.Builder.name` attribute, which is the name passed to the "
":option:`sphinx-build -b` option. The entry point value should equal the "
"dotted name of the extension module. Here is an example of how an entry "
"point for 'mybuilder' can be defined in the extension's ``setup.py``"
