"Builder extensions should define an entry point in the "
"``\"sphinx.builders\"`` group. The name of the entry point needs to match "
"your builder's :attr:`~.Builder.name` attribute, which is the name passed to"
" the :option:`sphinx-build --builder` option. The entry point value should "
"equal the dotted name of the extension module. Here is an example of how an "
"entry point for 'mybuilder' can be defined in the extension's "
"``pyproject.toml``"
