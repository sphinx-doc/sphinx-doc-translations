"Initially project maintainers have to collect all translatable strings (also"
" referred to as *messages*) to make them known to translators.  Sphinx "
"extracts these through invocation of ``sphinx-build -b gettext``."

"Every single element in the doctree will end up in a single message which "
"results in lists being equally split into different chunks while large "
"paragraphs will remain as coarsely-grained as they were in the original "
"document.  This grants seamless document updates while still providing a "
"little bit of context for translators in free-text passages.  It is the "
"maintainer's task to split up paragraphs which are too large as there is no "
"sane automated way to do that."

"After Sphinx successfully ran the "
