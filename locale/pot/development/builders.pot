The name of the entry point needs to match your builder's :attr:`~.Builder.name` attribute, which is the name passed to the :option:`sphinx-build -b` option. The entry point value should equal the dotted name of the extension module. Here is an example of how an entry point for 'mybuilder' can be defined in the extension's ``setup.py``"
