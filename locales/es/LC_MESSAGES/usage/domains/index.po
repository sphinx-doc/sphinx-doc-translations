"Originally, Sphinx was conceived for a single project, the documentation of "
"the Python language.  Shortly afterwards, it was made available for everyone"
" as a documentation tool, but the documentation of Python modules remained "
"deeply built in -- the most fundamental directives, like ``function``, were "
"designed for Python objects.  Since Sphinx has become somewhat popular, "
"interest developed in using it for many different purposes: C/C++ projects, "
"JavaScript, or even reStructuredText markup (like in this documentation)."

"A domain is a collection of markup (reStructuredText :term:`directive`\\ s "
