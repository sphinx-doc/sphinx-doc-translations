"An extension is simply a Python module with a ``setup()`` function. A user "
"activates the extension by placing the extension's module name (or a sub-"
"module) in their :confval:`extensions` configuration value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:23
msgid ""
"When :program:`sphinx-build` is executed, Sphinx will attempt to import each"
" module that is listed, and execute ``yourmodule.setup(app)``. This function"
" is used to prepare the extension (e.g., by executing Python code), linking "
"resources that Sphinx uses in the build process (like CSS or HTML files), "
"and notifying Sphinx of everything the extension offers (such as directive "
"or role definitions). The ``app`` argument is an instance of "
":class:`.Sphinx` and gives you control over most aspects of the Sphinx "
"build."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:33

"The configuration file itself can be treated as an extension if it contains "

msgid "**Application**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:51
msgid ""
"The application object (usually called ``app``) is an instance of "

"The build environment object (usually called ``env``) is an instance of "

"serialized to disk after each build."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:64

msgid "**Builder**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:72
msgid ""
"The builder object (usually called ``builder``) is an instance of a specific"

msgid ""
"One thing that is vital in order to understand extension mechanisms is the "
"way in which a Sphinx project is built: this works in several phases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:98
msgid "**Phase 0: Initialization**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:100
msgid ""
"In this phase, almost nothing of interest to us happens.  The source "
"directory is searched for source files, and extensions are initialized. "
"Should a stored build environment exist, it is loaded, otherwise a new one "
"is created."

msgid "**Phase 1: Reading**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:107
msgid ""
"In Phase 1, all source files (and on subsequent builds, those that are new "
"or changed) are read and parsed.  This is the phase where directives and "
"roles are encountered by docutils, and the corresponding code is executed.  "
"The output of this phase is a *doctree* for each source file; that is a tree"
" of docutils nodes.  For document elements that aren't fully known until all"
" existing files are read, temporary nodes are created."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:114
msgid ""
"There are nodes provided by docutils, which are documented `in the docutils "
"documentation <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/doctree.html>`__. "
"Additional nodes are provided by Sphinx and :ref:`documented here <nodes>`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:118
msgid ""
"During reading, the build environment is updated with all meta- and cross "
"reference data of the read documents, such as labels, the names of headings,"
" described Python objects and index entries.  This will later be used to "
"replace the temporary nodes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:123
msgid ""
"The parsed doctrees are stored on the disk, because it is not possible to "

msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:132
msgid ""
"Now that the metadata and cross-reference data of all existing documents is "
"known, all temporary nodes are replaced by nodes that can be converted into "
"output using components called transforms.  For example, links are created "
"for object references that exist, and simple literal nodes are created for "
"those that don't."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:138
msgid "**Phase 4: Writing**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:140
msgid ""
"This phase converts the resolved doctrees to the desired output format, such"
" as HTML or LaTeX.  This happens via a so-called docutils writer that visits"
" the individual nodes of each doctree and produces some output in the "
"process."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:146
msgid ""
"Some builders deviate from this general build plan, for example, the builder"
" that checks external links does not need anything more than the parsed "
"doctrees and therefore does not have phases 2--4."

msgid ""
"``'version'``: a string that identifies the extension version.  It is used "

msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:165

"given, Sphinx considers the extension does not stores any data to "
"environment."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/index.rst:170
msgid ""
"``'parallel_read_safe'``: a boolean that specifies if parallel reading of "

"parallel-read-safe after checking that it is."
msgstr ""
