"Unlike :ref:`tutorial-extending-syntax` and :ref:`tutorial-extend-build`, "
"this directive doesn't derive from :class:`docutils.parsers.rst.Directive` "
"and doesn't define a ``run`` method. Instead, it derives from "
":class:`sphinx.directives.ObjectDescription` and defines  "
"``handle_signature`` and ``add_target_and_index`` methods. This is because "
"``ObjectDescription`` is a special-purpose directive that's intended for "
"describing things like classes, functions, or, in our case, recipes. More "
"specifically, ``handle_signature`` implements parsing the signature of the "
"directive and passes on the object's name and type to its superclass, while "
"``add_target_and_index`` adds a target (to link to) and an entry to the "
"index for this node."

"Both ``IngredientIndex`` and ``RecipeIndex`` are derived from "

"Both indices use the method :meth:`Index.generate` to do their work. This "

"A Sphinx domain is a specialized container that ties together roles, "

msgid ""
"There are some interesting things to note about this ``recipe`` domain and "
"domains in general. Firstly, we actually register our directives, roles and "
"indices here, via the ``directives``, ``roles`` and ``indices`` attributes, "
"rather than via calls later on in ``setup``. We can also note that we aren't"
" actually defining a custom role and are instead reusing the "
":class:`sphinx.roles.XRefRole` role and defining the "
":class:`sphinx.domains.Domain.resolve_xref` method. This method takes two "
"arguments, ``typ`` and ``target``, which refer to the cross-reference type "
"and its target name. We'll use ``target`` to resolve our destination from "
"our domain's ``recipes`` because we currently have only one type of node."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/development/tutorials/adding_domain.rst:158
msgid ""
"Moving on, we can see that we've defined ``initial_data``. The values "
"defined in ``initial_data`` will be copied to "
"``env.domaindata[domain_name]`` as the initial data of the domain, and "
"domain instances can access it via ``self.data``. We see that we have "
"defined two items in ``initial_data``: ``recipes`` and "
"``recipe_ingredients``. Each contains a list of all objects defined (i.e. "
"all recipes) and a hash that maps a canonical ingredient name to the list of"
" objects. The way we name objects is common across our extension and is "
"defined in the ``get_full_qualified_name`` method. For each object created, "
"the canonical name is ``recipe.<recipename>``, where ``<recipename>`` is the"
" name the documentation writer gives the object (a recipe). This enables the"
" extension to use different object types that share the same name. Having a "
"canonical name and central place for our objects is a huge advantage. Both "
"our indices and our cross-referencing code use this feature."

"This looks a little different to what we're used to seeing. There are no "
"calls to :meth:`~Sphinx.add_directive` or even :meth:`~Sphinx.add_role`. "
"Instead, we have a single call to :meth:`~Sphinx.add_domain` followed by "
"some initialization of the :doc:`standard domain </usage/domains/standard>`."
