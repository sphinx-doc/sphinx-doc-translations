"You can find several extensions contributed by users in the `sphinx-"

" hosted elsewhere. The `awesome-sphinxdoc`__ and `sphinx-extensions`__ "

"Extensions local to a project should be put within the project's directory "

"in the ``exts`` subdirectory of the project root, put into :file:`conf.py`:"
