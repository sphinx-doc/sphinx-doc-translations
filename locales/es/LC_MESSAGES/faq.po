"tl;dr: *docutils* converts reStructuredText to multiple output formats. "

msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/faq.rst:160
msgid ""
"`docutils`__ is a text processing system for converting plain text "
"documentation into other, richer formats. As noted in the `docutils "
"documentation`__, docutils uses *readers* to read a document, *parsers* for "
"parsing plain text formats into an internal tree representation made up of "
"different types of *nodes*, and *writers* to output this tree in various "
"document formats.  docutils provides parsers for one plain text format - "
"`reStructuredText`__ - though other, *out-of-tree* parsers have been "
"implemented including Sphinx's :doc:`Markdown parser </usage/markdown>`. On "
"the other hand, it provides writers for many different formats including "
"HTML, LaTeX, man pages, Open Document Format and XML."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/faq.rst:171
msgid ""
"docutils exposes all of its functionality through a variety of `front-end "
"tools`__, such as ``rst2html``, ``rst2odt`` and ``rst2xml``. Crucially "
"though, all of these tools, and docutils itself, are concerned with "
"individual documents.  They don't support concepts such as cross-"
"referencing, indexing of documents, or the construction of a document "
"hierarchy (typically manifesting in a table of contents)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/faq.rst:178
msgid ""
"Sphinx builds upon docutils by harnessing docutils' readers and parsers and "
"providing its own :doc:`/usage/builders/index`. As a result, Sphinx wraps "
"some of the *writers* provided by docutils. This allows Sphinx to provide "
"many features that would simply not be possible with docutils, such as those"
" outlined above."

"For some readers you can use embedded or external fonts using the CSS "
"``@font-face`` directive.  This is *extremely* useful for code listings "
"which are often cut at the right margin.  The default Courier font (or "
"variant) is quite wide and you can only display up to 60 characters on a "
"line.  If you replace it with a narrower font, you can get more characters "
"on a line.  You may even use `FontForge <https://fontforge.github.io/>`_ and"

"generally the best way to view Sphinx-based documents since they often make "
