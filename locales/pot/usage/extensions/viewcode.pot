msgid "This extension looks at your Python object descriptions (``.. class::``, ``.. function::`` etc.) and tries to find the source files where the objects are contained.  When found, a separate HTML page will be output for each module with a highlighted version of the source code, and a link will be added to all object descriptions that leads to the source code of the described object.  A link back from the source to the description will also be inserted."
