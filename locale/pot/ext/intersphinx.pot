#: ..\..\sphinx\doc\ext\intersphinx.rst:14
msgid "Usage is simple: whenever Sphinx encounters a cross-reference that has no matching target in the current documentation set, it looks for targets in the documentation sets configured in :confval:`intersphinx_mapping`.  A reference like ``:py:class:`zipfile.ZipFile``` can then link to the Python documentation for the ZipFile class, without you having to specify where it is located exactly."
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\sphinx\doc\ext\intersphinx.rst:21
msgid "When using the \"new\" format (see below), you can even force lookup in a foreign set by prefixing the link target appropriately.  A link like ``:ref:`comparison manual <python:comparisons>``` will then link to the label \"comparisons\" in the doc set \"python\", if it exists."

msgid "Each Sphinx HTML build creates a file named :file:`objects.inv` that contains a mapping from object names to URIs relative to the HTML set's root."
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\sphinx\doc\ext\intersphinx.rst:31
msgid "Projects using the Intersphinx extension can specify the location of such mapping files in the :confval:`intersphinx_mapping` config value.  The mapping will then be used to resolve otherwise missing references to objects into links to the other documentation."
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\sphinx\doc\ext\intersphinx.rst:36
msgid "By default, the mapping file is assumed to be at the same location as the rest of the documentation; however, the location of the mapping file can also be specified individually, e.g. if the docs should be buildable without Internet access."

msgid "A dictionary mapping URIs to either ``None`` or an URI.  The keys are the base URI of the foreign Sphinx documentation sets and can be local paths or HTTP URIs.

The ``inventory`` indicates where the inventory file can be found: it can be ``None`` (at the same location as the base URI) or another local or HTTP URI."
msgstr ""

#: ..\..\sphinx\doc\ext\intersphinx.rst:77
msgid "The unique identifier can be used to prefix cross-reference targets, so that it is clear which intersphinx set the target belongs to.  A link like ``:ref:`comparison manual <python:comparisons>``` will link to the label \"comparisons\" in the doc set \"python\", if it exists."
