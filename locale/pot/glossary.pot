msgid "A class (inheriting from :class:`~sphinx.builders.Builder`) that takes parsed documents and performs an action on them.  Normally, builders translate the documents to an output format, but it is also possible to use the builder builders that e.g. check for broken links in the documentation, or build coverage information."

msgid "Since reST source files can have different extensions (some people like ``.txt``, some like ``.rst`` -- the extension can be configured with :confval:`source_suffix`) and different OSes have different path separators, Sphinx abstracts them: :dfn:`document names` are always relative to the :term:`source directory`, the extension is stripped, and path separators are converted to slashes.  All values, parameters and such referring to \"documents\" expect such document names."
