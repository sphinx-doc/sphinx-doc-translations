msgid "Originally, Sphinx was conceived for a single project, the documentation of the Python language.  Shortly afterwards, it was made available for everyone as a documentation tool, but the documentation of Python modules remained deeply built in -- the most fundamental directives, like ``function``, were designed for Python objects.  Since Sphinx has become somewhat popular, interest developed in using it for many different purposes: C/C++ projects, JavaScript, or even reStructuredText markup (like in this documentation)."
