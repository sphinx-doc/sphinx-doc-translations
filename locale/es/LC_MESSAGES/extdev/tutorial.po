"A new config value ``todo_include_todos`` (config value names should start "

"New event handlers: one for the :event:`doctree-resolved` event, to replace "

msgid ""
":meth:`~Sphinx.add_config_value` lets Sphinx know that it should recognize "
"the new *config value* ``todo_include_todos``, whose default value should be"

msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/tutorial.rst:175

"that influence reading (build phase 1)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/tutorial.rst:179
msgid ""
":meth:`~Sphinx.add_node` adds a new *node class* to the build system.  It "
"also can specify visitor functions for each supported output format.  These "
"visitor functions are needed when the new nodes stay until phase 4 -- since "
"the ``todolist`` node is always replaced in phase 3, it doesn't need any."
msgstr ""

"We need to create the two node classes ``todo`` and ``todolist`` later."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/tutorial.rst:214
msgid ""
"Node classes usually don't have to do anything except inherit from the "
"standard docutils classes defined in :mod:`docutils.nodes`.  ``todo`` "

"A directive class is a class deriving usually from "
":class:`docutils.parsers.rst.Directive`.  The directive interface is also "

"that the class should have attributes that configure the allowed markup, and"

msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/tutorial.rst:281
msgid ""
"Then, to act as a link target (from the todolist), the todo directive needs "
"to return a target node in addition to the todo node.  The target ID (in "
"HTML, this will be the anchor name) is generated by using "
"``env.new_serialno`` which returns a new unique integer on each call and "
"therefore leads to unique target names.  The target node is instantiated "
"without any text (the first two arguments)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/tutorial.rst:288
msgid ""
"On creating admonition node, the content body of the directive are parsed "

" parent node of parsed result, in our case the ``todo`` node."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/tutorial.rst:293
msgid ""
"Then, the todo node is added to the environment.  This is needed to be able "
"to create a list of all todo entries throughout the documentation, in the "
"place where the author puts a ``todolist`` directive.  For this case, the "
"environment attribute ``todo_all_todos`` is used (again, the name should be "
"unique, so it is prefixed by the extension name).  It does not exist when a "
"new environment is created, so the directive must check and create it if "
"necessary.  Various information about the todo entry's location are stored "
"along with a copy of the node."

":`env-purge-doc` event::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/tutorial.rst:334
msgid ""
"Since we store information from source files in the environment, which is "
"persistent, it may become out of date when the source file changes.  "
"Therefore, before each source file is read, the environment's records of it "
"are cleared, and the :event:`env-purge-doc` event gives extensions a chance "
"to do the same. Here we clear out all todos whose docname matches the given "
"one from the ``todo_all_todos`` list.  If there are todos left in the "
"document, they will be added again during parsing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/tutorial.rst:342
msgid ""
"The other handler belongs to the :event:`doctree-resolved` event.  This "
"event is emitted at the end of phase 3 and allows custom resolving to be "
"done::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/tutorial.rst:386
msgid ""
"It is a bit more involved.  If our new \"todo_include_todos\" config value "
"is false, all todo and todolist nodes are removed from the documents."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/extdev/tutorial.rst:389
msgid ""
"If not, todo nodes just stay where and how they are.  Todolist nodes are "
"replaced by a list of todo entries, complete with backlinks to the location "
"where they come from.  The list items are composed of the nodes from the "
"todo entry and docutils nodes created on the fly: a paragraph for each "
"entry, containing text that gives the location, and a link (reference node "
"containing an italic node) with the backreference.  The reference URI is "
"built by ``app.builder.get_relative_uri`` which creates a suitable URI "
"depending on the used builder, and appending the todo node's (the target's) "
"ID as the anchor name."
