msgid "If the name of a file in the ``static/`` directory of a theme (or in the user's static path, for that matter) ends with ``_t``, it will be processed by the template engine.  The ``_t`` will be left from the final file name.  For example, the *classic* theme has a file ``static/classic.css_t`` which uses templating to put the color options into the stylesheet.  When a documentation is built with the classic theme, the output directory will contain a ``_static/classic.css`` file where all template tags have been processed."
