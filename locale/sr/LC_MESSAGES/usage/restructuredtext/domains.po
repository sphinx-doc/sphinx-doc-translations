"Originally, Sphinx was conceived for a single project, the documentation of "
"the Python language.  Shortly afterwards, it was made available for everyone"
" as a documentation tool, but the documentation of Python modules remained "
"deeply built in -- the most fundamental directives, like ``function``, were "
"designed for Python objects.  Since Sphinx has become somewhat popular, "
"interest developed in using it for many different purposes: C/C++ projects, "

"Most domains provide a number of :dfn:`object description directives`, used "

"typically keep an internal index of all entites to aid cross-referencing. "
"Typically it will also add entries in the shown general index. If you want "
"to suppress the addition of an entry in the shown index, you can give the "
"directive option flag ``:noindexentry:``. If you want to typeset an object "
