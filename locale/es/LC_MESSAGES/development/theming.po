msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/development/theming.rst:285
msgid ""
"First, you may append ``_t`` to the end of any static files included with "

"Second, you may use the :meth:`Sphinx.add_js_file` method without pointing "
"it to a file. Normally, this method is used to insert a new JavaScript file "
"into your site. However, if you do *not* pass a file path, but instead pass "
"a string to the \"body\" argument, then this text will be inserted as "
"JavaScript into your site's head. This allows you to insert variables into "
"your project's JavaScript from Python."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/doc/development/theming.rst:316
msgid ""
"For example, the following code will read in a user-configured value and "
